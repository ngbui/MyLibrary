# My Library Project

## About the application

This application simulates a reading list, with which users can add books to and keep track of which books on 
the reading list that they have read and still need to read. After finishing a book, a user can then mark it as 
already read and if they want to, delete that book from their reading list. The users can view the books on the
reading list and calculate the number of already read books and to-read books. This application aids in a pleasant
and fuss-free reading experience. There is a console-based version and a GUI version.

## Why make a project about books and reading list?

Since I am an *avid book-reader*, I want to create a project that will both help me *apply theoretical in-class 
knowledge in my hobbies*. This way, I can stay passionate about my project while learning more about object-oriented 
programming fundamentals.

## Who will use it?

This project aims to give any book-lover a simple way to keep track of their reading list. 
Thus, the application is for a *wide range of audience*, from young teens to adults who want to keep
a catalogue of the books they have read and want to read.
